# 🎵 Music Therapy Digital Platform (MTDP)

A curated, evidence-based knowledge database for personalized music therapy.

## 📌 Introduction

With the rapid development of AI music generation models (e.g. SUNO) and large language models (LLMs), personalized digital music therapy is becoming increasingly feasible. However, the relationships between musical elements, intervention methods, and specific diseases remain fragmented and lack systematic, structured evidence.

**MTDP (Music Therapy Digital Platform)** addresses this gap by transforming large-scale clinical music therapy literature into a standardized, searchable, and extensible knowledge database.

## 📊 Data & Methods

* **Data source**: 328 peer-reviewed music therapy studies systematically collected from PubMed
* **Extraction framework**:

  * Manual extraction based on the **PICOS** model
  * LLM-powered automated information extraction
* **Quality control**: Dual verification (manual + AI-assisted)
* **Visualization**: Interactive charts and network diagrams built with **Vue 3** and modern JavaScript libraries

## 🧠 Knowledge Framework

The database is structured around four core components:

1. **Clinical Intervention Framework** – diseases, populations, clinical contexts
2. **Musical Content Framework** – music type, genre, tempo, structure
3. **Social Delivery Framework** – listening, singing, group therapy, etc.
4. **Intervention Dosage Framework** – frequency, duration, and intensity

## 🌍 Platform Features

* Covers **115+ diseases** across diverse clinical contexts
* Interactive visual exploration of music–disease–intervention relationships
* Downloadable datasets for research and development
* Designed for clinicians, researchers, and digital health developers

## 🎯 Impact

MTDP is the **first standardized and scalable knowledge database** in the field of music therapy. It bridges empirical diversity with digital precision, enabling:

* Evidence-based clinical decision support
* AI-driven personalized music interventions
* Future research in digital therapeutics and music-based healthcare
